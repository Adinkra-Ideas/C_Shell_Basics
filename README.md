# libft
This is the first draft of some of the codes I wrote using C programming language
during my Libft project at 42 Wolfsburg.

The libft is a project where new students at the 42 programming school are 
required to recode some standard library functions from scratch so that we
can learn and cement our understanding of the fundamentals of the C 
programming language.
